Use fixed-point arithmetic for real-time performance
Implement proper sensor modeling (IMU noise, GPS errors)

The current code implements a centralized leader-follower approach, but real-world swarm systems are fundamentally different. Let me break down the concepts:
Current Implementation (Centralized)
gotype Swarm struct {
    drones []*Drone
    leaderIdx int  // Single leader controls everything
    // Followers just copy leader's state with latency
}
Problems with this approach:

Single point of failure - if leader crashes, entire swarm fails
Not scalable - communication overhead grows linearly
Not realistic - no real swarm in nature works this way

Real Swarm Concepts
1. Distributed/Decentralized Swarms (Most Common)
Each drone makes decisions based on local information only:
gotype DistributedDrone struct {
    // Each drone only knows about nearby neighbors
    neighbors     []NeighborInfo
    localGoal     Vec3
    avoidanceList []Obstacle
    
    // Simple rules create complex behavior
    separationRadius float64  // Don't get too close
    alignmentRadius  float64  // Match neighbors' direction  
    cohesionRadius   float64  // Stay with the group
}

func (d *DistributedDrone) Update() {
    // Boids algorithm - only 3 rules needed:
    separation := d.calculateSeparation()  // Avoid crowding
    alignment := d.calculateAlignment()    // Align with neighbors
    cohesion := d.calculateCohesion()      // Move toward group center
    
    desiredVelocity := separation.Add(alignment).Add(cohesion)
    d.steerToward(desiredVelocity)
}
2. Emergent Behavior Examples
Starling murmurations use just these rules:
go// Each bird follows 3 simple rules:
1. Avoid collision with nearest 6-7 neighbors
2. Match velocity of neighbors within 2-3 body lengths  
3. Move toward average position of distant neighbors (up to 50m)
Result: Complex, fluid group movement with no leader!
3. Hierarchical Swarms (Military/Industrial)
gotype HierarchicalSwarm struct {
    squads []Squad  // Multiple small groups
}

type Squad struct {
    leader    *Drone
    members   []*Drone  // 3-8 drones per squad
    objective LocalMission
}
Better Implementation
Here's how a realistic distributed swarm should work:
gotype RealisticSwarm struct {
    drones []*Drone
    // No central leader!
}

type SwarmDrone struct {
    *Drone
    
    // Local perception only
    sensorRange    float64
    neighbors      []NeighborInfo
    obstacles      []ObstacleInfo
    
    // Distributed consensus
    localConsensus Formation
    globalGoal     Vec3  // Shared mission objective
    
    // Communication with limited range/bandwidth
    commRange      float64
    messageQueue   []SwarmMessage
    lastHeartbeat  time.Time
}

func (d *SwarmDrone) UpdateSwarmBehavior(dt float64) {
    // 1. Sense local environment
    d.updateNeighbors()
    
    // 2. Apply swarm rules (distributed)
    forces := Vec3{}
    
    // Separation: avoid collision
    forces = forces.Add(d.separation().Mul(2.5))
    
    // Alignment: match neighbors' velocity  
    forces = forces.Add(d.alignment().Mul(1.0))
    
    // Cohesion: move toward local group center
    forces = forces.Add(d.cohesion().Mul(1.0))
    
    // Goal seeking: move toward mission objective
    forces = forces.Add(d.seekGoal().Mul(0.8))
    
    // 3. Execute movement
    d.applyForce(forces, dt)
    
    // 4. Communicate with neighbors (limited bandwidth)
    d.broadcastState()
}

// Each drone only knows about nearby neighbors
func (d *SwarmDrone) updateNeighbors() {
    d.neighbors = d.neighbors[:0]
    
    for _, other := range allDrones {
        if other == d { continue }
        
        dist := d.Position.Sub(other.Position).Length()
        if dist < d.sensorRange {
            d.neighbors = append(d.neighbors, NeighborInfo{
                Drone: other,
                Distance: dist,
                RelativeVelocity: other.Velocity.Sub(d.Velocity),
            })
        }
    }
}
Communication Models
Real-World Constraints:
gotype CommSystem struct {
    // Realistic limitations
    range_m       float64  // ~1-5km for drone-to-drone
    bandwidth_bps int      // ~100kbps shared among all neighbors
    latency_ms    int      // 10-100ms depending on distance
    packetLoss    float64  // 1-5% in good conditions
}

// Messages must be tiny due to bandwidth limits
type SwarmMessage struct {
    SenderID    uint8     // 1 byte
    Position    [3]int16  // 6 bytes (compressed)
    Velocity    [3]int8   // 3 bytes (compressed)  
    Status      uint8     // 1 byte (battery, health, etc.)
    Timestamp   uint16    // 2 bytes
    // Total: 13 bytes per message
}
Real-World Examples
Military Swarms (Distributed)

Each drone has identical software
No designated leader
Mission objectives shared via encrypted mesh network
Self-organizing based on local conditions

Light Shows (Hierarchical)

Ground control system broadcasts timing
Each drone has pre-programmed sequence
Local collision avoidance only

Search & Rescue (Hybrid)
go// Distributed search with emergent coverage
func (d *SwarmDrone) searchBehavior() {
    // Avoid areas already searched by others
    searchedAreas := d.getNeighborSearchHistory()
    
    // Move toward unexplored regions
    target := d.findUnexploredArea(searchedAreas)
    
    // Maintain communication network topology
    if d.isolationRisk() > 0.7 {
        target = d.moveTowardSwarm()  // Don't get isolated
    }
}
Key Insights

No single leader - failure of any drone doesn't break the swarm
Local rules create global behavior - emergence, not control
Limited communication - bandwidth and range constraints are critical
Fault tolerance - swarm adapts when members are lost
Scalability - works with 10 or 10,000 drones
